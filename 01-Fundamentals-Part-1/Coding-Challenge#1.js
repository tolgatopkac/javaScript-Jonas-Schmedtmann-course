/* Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall */

const weightMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const weightJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;
// ----------------------------------------------------------------
const weightMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const weightJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const bmiMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
const bmiJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
console.log(bmiMark.toFixed(2)); //27.31  // 27.88
console.log(bmiJohn.toFixed(2)); //24.19 //2744
console.log(markHigherBMI); //true //false
