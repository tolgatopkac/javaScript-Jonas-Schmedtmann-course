/* Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" */

const weightMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const weightJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;
// ----------------------------------------------------------------
const weightMark = 95;
const heightMark = 1.88;
const weightJohn = 85;
const heightJohn = 1.76;

const bmiMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
const bmiJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

if (bmiMark > bmiJohn) {
  console.log(
    `Mark's BMI (${bmiMark.toFixed(
      2
    )}) is higher than John's (${bmiJohn.toFixed(2)})`
  );
} else {
  console.log(
    `John's BMI (${bmiJohn.toFixed(
      2
    )}) is higher than Mark's (${bmiMark.toFixed(2)})`
  );
}
